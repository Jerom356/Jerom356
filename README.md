<!--
I am just a pathetic creature made up of bone and flesh. I act on different signals from processed acoustic and visual waves into emotions on which my neurons think and perform actions, just a set of predefined elements and mechanizing on saved data.

I am not a human. I don't matter. Neither does everything I've done and put effort for, nor my existence.
